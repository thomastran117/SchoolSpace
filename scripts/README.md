# Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains powershell scripts for Windows and shell scripts for Linux. These scripts automate tedious tasks such as database migration, docker, local start or setup. They also contains tools that may be useful for development such as formating and clearing a port. These scripts can be run directly; however, it is better to invoke them with [app](../app.ps1) found in the root directory
