# Hooks

Hooks are Fastify ways to run something before a specific route hits. In otherwords, unlike plugins where they are always ran regardless of the route, hooks are route specific.

Refer to [Fastify Hooks](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/) to learn more on usage and how to create one.
