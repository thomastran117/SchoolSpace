# SchoolSpace

At its core, SchoolSpace is a mock version of BrightSpace. It supports students and teachers being able to enroll in classes, provide assignments and grades. Additionally, it supports the ability to provide lectures. It has a live dashboard to see real-time information concerning students, grades etc.

As for students, students have the ability to submit assignments, view their performance and track their progress with a dashboard, and a calender implementation.

Future iterations will likely include an AI transcription for lectures and note summary for PDF versions.
